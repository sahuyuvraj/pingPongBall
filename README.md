# pingPongBall

Created a simple desktop application of ping pong ball using Java swing and concepts of object oriented programming. A simple GUI with the objective to hit the ball with the paddle and not let it leave the game screen. Player 1 can control its paddle using W and S keys. Player 2 can control its paddle using UP and DOWN ARROW keys.
